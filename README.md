ðŸ“Œ Digital Voting System
A project using Proteus for simulating a secure electronic voting system.

ðŸ“– Introduction
This project demonstrates a Digital Voting System using Logisim Evolution. The system is designed to provide a secure and reliable electronic voting process using logic circuits and microcontrollers. It ensures that each voter can cast vote, and the results are displayed in real time.

âœ¨ Features
-  Electronic Voting Process â€“ Uses digital logic to simulate secure voting.
-  Live Vote Counting â€“ Displays real-time vote count using a 7-segment display.
-  Simulation in Logisim Evolution â€“ Circuit design tested and verified in Logisim Evolution. 

ðŸ”§ Components Used
1. Buttons- as candidates and vote casting.
2. 7-Segment Display â€“ Displays the number of votes.
3. Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) â€“ Controls voting logic.
4. counters - for votes counting increments. 
5. Power Supply â€“ Provides power to the circuit.
   
ðŸ›  How to Run the Simulation
- Download and Install Logisim Evolution if you haven't already.
- Open the project.
- Run the simulation to test the voting system.
- Press different vote buttons to simulate voting.
- Observe the real-time vote count on the 7-segment display.
