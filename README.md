📌 Digital Voting System
A project using Proteus for simulating a secure electronic voting system.

📖 Introduction
This project demonstrates a Digital Voting System using Proteus. The system is designed to provide a secure and reliable electronic voting process using logic circuits and microcontrollers. It ensures that each voter can cast only one vote, and the results are displayed in real time.

✨ Features

✔️ Electronic Voting Process – Uses digital logic to simulate secure voting.
✔️ Unique Voting Mechanism – Ensures one vote per user.
✔️ Live Vote Counting – Displays real-time vote count using a 7-segment display.
✔️ Secure Circuit Design – Prevents duplicate voting.
✔️ Simulation in Proteus – Circuit design tested and verified in Proteus.

🔧 Components Used
1. Microcontroller (e.g., PIC, Arduino, or 8051) (If applicable)
2. 7-Segment Display – Displays the number of votes.
3. 555 Timer – Generates clock pulses for logic circuits.
4. Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) – Controls voting logic.
5. Push Buttons – Represents voting inputs.
6. Resistors & Capacitors – Ensures circuit stability.
7. Power Supply (5V/9V) – Provides power to the circuit.
   
🛠 How to Run the Simulation
- Download and Install Proteus if you haven't already.
- Open the Proteus project file (.DSN) in Proteus.
- Run the simulation to test the voting system.
- Press different vote buttons to simulate voting.
- Observe the real-time vote count on the 7-segment display.
