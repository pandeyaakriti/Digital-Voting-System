📌 Digital Voting System
A project using Proteus for simulating a secure electronic voting system.

📖 Introduction
This project demonstrates a Digital Voting System using Proteus. The system is designed to provide a secure and reliable electronic voting process using logic circuits and microcontrollers. It ensures that each voter can cast only one vote, and the results are displayed in real time.

✨ Features
✔️ Electronic Voting Process – Uses digital logic to simulate secure voting.
✔️ Unique Voting Mechanism – Ensures one vote per user.
✔️ Live Vote Counting – Displays real-time vote count using a 7-segment display.
✔️ Secure Circuit Design – Prevents duplicate voting.
✔️ Simulation in Proteus – Circuit design tested and verified in Proteus.

🔧 Components Used
Microcontroller (e.g., PIC, Arduino, or 8051) (If applicable)
7-Segment Display – Displays the number of votes.
555 Timer – Generates clock pulses for logic circuits.
Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) – Controls voting logic.
Push Buttons – Represents voting inputs.
Resistors & Capacitors – Ensures circuit stability.
Power Supply (5V/9V) – Provides power to the circuit.
🛠 How to Run the Simulation
Download and Install Proteus if you haven't already.
Open the Proteus project file (.DSN) in Proteus.
Run the simulation to test the voting system.
Press different vote buttons to simulate voting.
Observe the real-time vote count on the 7-segment display.
